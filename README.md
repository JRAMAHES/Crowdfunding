The Chef’s Knife skills.
I can make a video trailer when all of the visitors can view the video and learn all of the knife’s skills step by step 
from the bottom until the top. By accessing to the video, I will make it as a game at the beginning. After a few steps, 
I will encourage the entire visitor to cross the wall by subscribing in the video and jumping to the next step and start l
earning the hardest knives skills. When they learned the all of the knife’s skills I will test them and I will give the diploma
where they will be able to prove that they complete all of the steps and they know how to use the knives very well. 
At the final of the video trailer they must pay $1.00 to get a copy diploma.
